/* 
javascript is dynamiccally and wealy typed, meaning type coersion, and truthy and falsy. 

typescript makes it statically and strongly typed. It is a jasasctipt superset. 

angular is written in typescript by default. the largest benefit is large projects have less bugs and sort of self document. 

use tsc --init to set up a config file. 
use tsc <file> --watch to watch for changes and recompile to js output.
