Oauth is a standard for authentication and authorization.


wireshark is a tool for network packet analysis. 

SSL is a standard for encrypting network traffic. TLS is the successor to SSL.

HTTPS is a standard for encrypting network traffic over HTTP.  the data is encrypted before it is sent over the network with TLS

Digital Certificates are used to verify the identity of a server. these are used by HTTPS to verify the identity of the server. these are free from Let's Encrypt, but it requires a domain name. Self-signed certificates are also possible, but they are not trusted by browsers. CA-signed certificates are also possible, but they are expensive.
