/* 
the five main data base models are: 
1. relational
    moslty used for structured data and SQL and tables
2. document
    mostly used for unstructured data and NoSQL
    rather than rows and columns, documents are stored as documents. 
3. key-value
  redis is an example of a key-value database
4. graph
  neo4j is an example of a graph database. good for data that has relationships, like social networks
5. wide-column
  amazon apache is an example of a wide-column database.  good for data that has a lot of columns, like sensor data. 


  a database is a system of hardware and software that allows a user to organize, store, and use data. 

  SQL is a language for interacting with relational databases.
  a query is a structured request for data from a database. like a question you ask a database.

  SQL is declarative.  you tell the database what you want, not how to get it. declarative languages are easier to read and write. limited to what the language allows you to do.
  sql means structured enlish query language. 

  imperative languages are procedural.  you tell the database how to get the data.  imperative languages are harder to read and write. You have to tell the database how to get the data. way more options for creating custom queries.
