continuous integration and continuous delivery and continuous deployment. 

CI is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a developer pushes changes. It part of the agile development process. 

Continuous Delivery automates the release of software. It is the process of automating the build, test, and release of software.

continuous deployment is the process of automatically deploying code to production after it passes a series of tests. means that every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. its the final target of continuous delivery.

in github actions, the ci.yml file is the file that contains the steps to run the ci process. (workflow configuration file)
we can use the actions from the marketplace to run the ci process without writing the code ourselves.
