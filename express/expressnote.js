//route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

// The route parameters are specified using a colon (:) prefix followed by the name of the route parameter as in the following example:

// app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', function (req, res) {})

// The captured values of route parameters are always strings. If the need arises, they can be converted to numbers by using the built-in JavaScript function Number(). For example, the following code converts the captured value of the route parameter :userId to a number: const userId = Number(req.params.userId);

//middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

//in express the order of middleware is important. If you want to use a middleware function in an application, you must load the middleware function into the request-processing pipeline. The following code loads a middleware function into a chain of middleware functions:

//app.use(function, function, function,( req, res, next){})

//app.use(myMiddleware);

//the following code loads a middleware function into a chain of middleware functions at a path for GET requests to the root of the app: app.get('/', myMiddleware);
